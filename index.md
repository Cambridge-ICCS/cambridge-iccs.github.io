<p class="main_content">
The <strong>Institute of Computing for Climate Science</strong>
studies and supports the role of software engineering, computer
science, artificial intelligence, and data science within climate
science.  <br /><br />

The institute comprises a collaboration between <a
href="https://www.zero.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Zero</a>, the Departments
of <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Computer Science and
Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">Applied
Mathematics and Theoretical Physics</a>, and <a
href="https://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/">University Information Services</a>
at the University of Cambridge.
<br /><br />

The institute forms part of the larger <a
href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-institute-for-scientific-software/">
Virtual Institute for Scientific Software (VISS)</a> established by <a
href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/">Schmidt Futures</a> addressing
the growing demand for software engineers with backgrounds in science,
complex data and mathematics who can build dynamic, scalable, open
software to facilitate accelerated scientific discovery across fields.
We work closely with the teams comprising the 
  <a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-earth-system-research-institute-vesri/">Virtual Earth Systems Research Institute (VESRI)</a>.
