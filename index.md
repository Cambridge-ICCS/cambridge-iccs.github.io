Computational modelling is key to modern climate science. But models are becoming
increasingly complex as we seek to understand our physical world in more depth
and model it at higher fidelity. The <strong>Institute of Computing
for Climate Science</strong> studies and supports the role of software engineering, computer science, artificial
