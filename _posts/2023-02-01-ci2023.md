We are very pleased to be hosting the [12th International Conference on Climate Informatics](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/climate-informatics-2023/) 
at the University of Cambridge in April.

The Climate Informatics conference series aims to bring together researchers and users across different disciplines and sectors to forge international collaboration between climate science, data science, and computer science, share state-of-art developments in climate data and informatics, and accelerate the rate of discovery in climate science and adaptation of climate applications.

Climate Informatics is an open community interested in research combining climate science with approaches from statistics, machine learning and data mining. We hope to stimulate discussion of new ideas, foster new collaborations, grow the community, and thus accelerate discovery across disciplinary boundaries.
