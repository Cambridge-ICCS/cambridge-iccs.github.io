During the week, you can book in a session with one of the RSE teams for advice, or to discuss ongoing projects.

__All activities, dinners, and accommodation are free!__ 

A few details are still being firmed-up, but the below schedule gives a good indication of the structure and timing of everything.

The walk from Jesus College to the CMS takes about 25 minutes. There will be a mini-bus taxi available leaving from Jesus College at 08:30.
Those wishing to walk can join Dominic at 08:25 at the Porter's lodge to walk over, going a very scenic route through the old colleges and past the library.

It has profound effects on the speed of post-fire ecosystem recovery and therefore on water- and energy-exchanges with the atmosphere and the carbon cycle. However, the ability to resprout requires investing in carbon storage. Balancing the benefits of rapid recovery of photosynthesis against the costs of carbon storage implies that resprouting is an optimal behaviour in environments where fire is neither too frequent nor too infrequent. Although there is anecdotal support for this assertion, there has been little quantitative investigation of the types of fire regime where resprouting is an optimal strategy. In this study, we use data on the abundance of woody species in Europe and Australia derived from the sPlotOpen database combined with information on whether the species present can resprout or not, derived from regional and global plant trait databases and field information, to examine how changes in the abundance of resprouting species varies with fire return interval and with fire intensity. We show that the proportion of resprouting species decreases as fire return intervals increase, while the abundance of resprouters is maximal at intermediate levels of fire intensity. This work suggests that it should be possible to model the occurrence and abundance of resprouting using an eco-evolutionary optimality approach based on balancing the costs and benefits of resprouting under different fire regimes.</span> |
