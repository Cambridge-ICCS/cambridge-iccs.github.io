## Monday 19th September, Jesus College

Due to the state funeral for the Queen which is happening on this day,
we have had to re-organise and merge Monday's scientific programme into the rest of
the week. Instead, we will have a low-key, informal start with informal networking
during the day at Jesus College.

|  Start | End  | Event   |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| 12:30   | 14:00 | Lunch at Jesus College in the [Webb Library](https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/webb-library) |

| 19:00  | - | <span class='social'>Welcome dinner at [Six Cambridge](https://www.sixcambridge.co.uk/)</span> |

## Tuesday 20th September, Centre for Mathematical Sciences (MR2)

The walk from Jesus College to the CMS takes about 25 minutes. There will be a mini-bus taxi available leaving from Jesus College at 08:30.
Those wishing to walk can join Dominic at 08:25 at the Porter's lodge to walk over, going a very scenic route through the old colleges and past the library.

[Location of MR2 is in the 'core' part of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, downstairs](http://www.cms.cam.ac.uk/meeting-rooms)

Keshav](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), University of Cambridge</i> <span class="abstract">Carbon credits--especially those derived from nature-based solutions such as reforestation or averted deforestation--are deservedly viewed as being untrustworthy and their use by airlines and oil companies a barely-concealed form of greenwashing. In this talk, I will present a solution to these issues that leverages advances in earth observation, AI, cloud storage, and blockchain. This solution is being prototyped by the Cambridge Center for Carbon Credits (https://4c.cst.cam.ac.uk ) and I will discuss the current status and our vision for the future.</span> |

| 13:30  | 14:20 | <span class='sci'>Science talk: SASIP - __Multi-scale sea ice and ocean modeling. Why and why now?__</span> <i>[Chris Horvat](http://www.chrv.at/), Brown University</i> <span class="abstract">Significant changes to Earth's climate are most prominent in the polar regions --- especially in the Arctic, where surface temperatures have risen by up to 3x the global mean. In turn, the decline of Arctic sea ice, land ice, and permafrost has ushered in a new status quo for local food webs, peoples, and climate. New under-ice ecosystems and chemical exchange, alterations to transportation and ways of living, and disrupted atmospheric and oceanic variability are all features of the emergent "New Arctic." In spite (perhaps because) of this, climate models have repeatedly failed to capture these changes, so doubts loom over whether forecasts of Arctic and Antarctic change can be relied upon in the future. Here I'll discuss several newly observed features of the Arctic coupled system and how many are driven by a similar quality: the fragmented and fractal nature of the Arctic sea ice cover, which contemporary modeling frameworks largely ignore. I'll discuss efforts through the Scale Aware Sea Ice Project to observe, diagnose and rectify problems associated with the incorrect treatment of Arctic sea ice. These are led by (1) improved resolved-scale modeling of fragmented sea ice through the neXtSIM sea ice model, (2) new scale-aware parameterizations of ocean turbulence, waves, and air-sea exchange that drive polar change in climate models, and (3) new observations of sea ice and ocean variability for assimilating into cutting-edge forecast models.</span> |
| 14:20  | 15:05 | <span class='sci'>Science talk (DataWave) __Towards an improved understanding and representation of atmospheric gravity waves__ </span> <i>[Aditi Sheshadri](https://profiles.stanford.edu/aditi-sheshadri), Stanford University</i><span class="abstract">Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are ubiquitously excited on the Earth and are critical drivers of the atmospheric circulation, however, they present a challenge to climate prediction: waves on scales of 102-105m can neither be systematically measured with conventional observational systems, nor properly resolved in atmospheric models. I will describe recent work in my group aimed at understanding the effects of gravity waves on climate variability and improving their representation in GCMs. a) We have leveraged high-resolution data from balloon flights launched by Loon LLC, originally deployed for internet access. The opportunistic Loon dataset, though not from a scientific campaign, gives us access to thousands of balloon flights with measurements of position, pressure, and temperature from which we have inferred statistics of gravity wave motions in the lower stratosphere. b) We have developed a machine learning GW parameterization, coupled it to a global climate model, showed that it is stable and accurate when run online, and that it reproduces features of the climate that depend critically on GWs. c) I will describe recent results with regard to calibration and uncertainty quantification of a popular gravity wave parameterization.</span> |

A global sensitivity analysis of all its melt pond parameters indicate that parameters controlling the amount of melt water allowed to run off to the ocean (and in particular that meltwater added to the melt ponds in early melting season) plays a substantial effect on the sea ice properties.<br />We perform simulations of the Icepack model forced by hourly data from the Climate Forecasting System Version 2 dataset, over a range of Arctic locations, and show that neural networks demonstrate the ability to learn and predict output given by the level-ice melt pond parametrisation, and furthermore do not suffer from drift or instability when used in the Icepack model replacing the melt pond parametrisation itself. With uncertainty around the precise values of many sea ice parameters, our work opens the possibility of, for example, applying hybrid data assimilation and machine learning techniques that have been used to incorporate direct (often spare and noisy) data to infer unresolved scale parametrisations, in sea ice models.</span> |

| 11:00  | 11:30 | <span class='sci'>Science talk (LEMONTREE) - __Relationships between resprouting and fire regimes__</span> <i>[Yicheng Shen](https://www.reading.ac.uk/ges/staff/yicheng-shen), University of Reading</i> <span class="abstract">Resprouting is a resilience trait that allows individuals to regenerate rapidly following fire. It has profound effects on the speed of post-fire ecosystem recovery and therefore on water- and energy-exchanges with the atmosphere and the carbon cycle. However, the ability to resprout requires investing in carbon storage. Balancing the benefits of rapid recovery of photosynthesis against the costs of carbon storage implies that resprouting is an optimal behaviour in environments where fire is neither too frequent nor too infrequent. Although there is anecdotal support for this assertion, there has been little quantitative investigation of the types of fire regime where resprouting is an optimal strategy. In this study, we use data on the abundance of woody species in Europe and Australia derived from the sPlotOpen database combined with information on whether the species present can resprout or not, derived from regional and global plant trait databases and field information, to examine how changes in the abundance of resprouting species varies with fire return interval and with fire intensity. We show that the proportion of resprouting species decreases as fire return intervals increase, while the abundance of resprouters is maximal at intermediate levels of fire intensity. This work suggests that it should be possible to model the occurrence and abundance of resprouting using an eco-evolutionary optimality approach based on balancing the costs and benefits of resprouting under different fire regimes.</span> |

Creating these numerical solvers is a complex task that requires the composition of the right differential equation with suitable discretisations, parametrisations, solvers and preconditioners. In addition, many geoscientific simulation challenges are inverse problems which require the numerical solution of the adjoint PDE. Combine all of this with increasingly sophisticated parallel computing systems and creating geoscientific solutions becomes complex, labour-intensive and error-prone. Here I will present a radically different alternative. The Firedrake system allows model developers to express the simualation they wish to conduct in a high-level mathematical language embedded in Python. High performance parallel implementations are automatically generated and the solution returned. Parallelisation and the evaluation of adjoint simulations are fully automated. Here I will present a short overview of the Firedrake system before we move on to a practical hands-on demonstration using Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. Participants should bring their laptops and be ready to participate. No software installation will be required.</span> |

In this session we will explore the fundamentals of parallel programming with MPI and GPU, as well as performance engineering in Julia. The goal is to provide an intuition of what approaches for parallelism are out there and how one could apply them in their own work. We will use the Julia programming language to explore these concepts, but no prior knowledge of it is required.</span> |

Performing this work and effectively sharing data and code in a large, collaborative project is challenging. In this talk, I will give an overview of different open-source software and data infrastructure components used in the M2LInES project and the broader Pangeo community, including xarray, zarr, xgcm, xbatcher, Pangeo Forge, commercial cloud computing, and Open Storage Network. I will conclude with a future vision for a decentralized data platform for collaborative data-intensive science.</span> |
