Computational modelling is key to climate science. But models are becoming
increasingly complex as we seek to understand our physical world in more depth
and model it at higher fidelity. The <strong>Institute of Computing
for Climate Science</strong> studies and supports the role of software engineering, computer science, artificial
intelligence, and data science within climate science.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
As the computational models become increasingly complicated, and more data is produced — ‘input’ from observation as well as ‘output’ from the models — there are three pressing challenges which we seek to address:
<ol>
<li><i>Software engineering</i> is required to ensure that the models are robust, resource-efficient, maintainable, extendable, usable, interpretable and sustainable;
</li>
<li><i>Data science</i> is required to ensure that the maximum valuable information is extracted from the various available data streams reliably and credibly;
</li>
<li><i>Computer science</i> is required to develop tools, programming systems, libraries, and even programming languages to support the sustainable and robust development and deployment of increasingly complex models.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Structure and Objectives</h3>

The institute is part of the larger <a
href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-institute-for-scientific-software/">
Virtual Institute for Scientific Software (VISS)</a> estbalished by <a
href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/">Schmidt Futures</a> addressing
the growing demand for software engineers with backgrounds in science,
complex data and mathematics who can build dynamic, scalable, open
software to facilitate accelerated scientific discovery across fields.

Cambridge's Institute of Computing for Climate Science (ICCS) will
apply its existing expertise in climate sciences and artificial
intelligence with the research teams from Schmidt Futures’ Virtual
Earth Systems Research Institute (VESRI) to address the specific
computation and research software needs in the area of climate
modelling.
