<h3>Challenges</h3>
As the computational models become increasingly complicated, and more data is produced — ‘input’ from observation as well as ‘output’ from the models — there are three pressing challenges which we seek to address:
<ol>
<li>Software engineering is required to ensure that the models are robust, resource-efficient, maintainable, extendable, usable, interpretable and sustainable;
</li>
<li>Data science is required to ensure that the maximum valuable information is extracted from the various available data streams reliably and credibly;
</li>
<li>Computer science is required to develop tools, programming systems, libraries, and even programming languages to support the sustainable and robust development and deployment of increasingly complex models.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
