<h4><i>Monday 19th - Friday 23rd September 2022, Cambridge, UK</i></h4>

The inaugural ICCS Summer School will take place as a hybrid event, both online and in person
in Cambridge, during the week of Monday 19th September 2022.

The summer school is free to attend and open to anyone with an interest in computational aspects
of climate science research. The summer school will combine a mix of training workshops, scientific
presentations, group discussions, social/networking activities, a poster reception, and a hackathon on the last day. 

The focus of the training workshops will be on best practice software engineering methods.
There will be chances for networking and fostering collaboration.
Attendees also have the opportunity to present their work via a poster and/or a lightning talk which 
may be of particular interst to early-career researchers who wish to get exposure and feedback on their work.

For members of [VESRI projects](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-earth-system-research-institute-vesri/), the summer school is also a chance to network between teams, give presentations on the scientific aims of your projects, and to meet and discuss with the Core team. VESRI leads will have the option to lead a scientific session on the core science underlying their project.

The current sketch of the programme is as follows:

|                | Morning                    | Afternoon                                       |

| Mon 19th    | <i><span style='color:#999;'>Arrival</span>                           | Poster reception with lunch + Welcome keynote + Science talk |
| Tue 20th   | Training workshops (x2)    | Training workshop + scientific session + discussion groups |
| Wed 21st | Training workshop + scientific session  | Lightning talks + __Excursion ([punting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat))) followed by banquet in college__ |
| Thu 22nd  | Training workshop + scientific session | Discussion groups + Lightning talks + Hackathon pitches |
| Fri 23rd    | Hackathon | Hackathon + presentations, culminating in prizes |

Likely training workshop topics:

  * Verification and testing
  * Pairing and code review
  * Using Git and GitHub effectively
  * Training machine learning models
  * "Green in Code" course (how to write less resource intensive code)

On Thursday afternoon, we will have an opportunity for attendees to pitch a project for the Hackathon. This could
be either an idea for a new project or an existing project. There is then a chance to form groups for the
Hackathon, which will take place during the day Friday. On Friday afternoon, each team will have a chance to present
what they have done and a panel of judges will award a number of prizes which will be presented in the final
session.

Depending on demand, we may organise a block booking of accommodation at a college which is usually cheaper than a local hotel. Otherwise, Cambridge is replete with good quality hotels and [most colleges also make their rooms available](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/cambridge/home/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_KO7BKHd9D9yhAt5q80cBarTw0ltRwbJ-GHXpl-zjx4eiIgEqdPeJQaAjzcEALw_wcB) which is an excellent way to soak up more of the Cambridge atmosphere.

If you plan to attend in person, please given an indication of which days you will stay in Cambridge in the sign-up.

#### COVID-19

For those attending in-person, we will be closely monitoring the situation and following the guidelines of the UK government at the time of the summer school.
