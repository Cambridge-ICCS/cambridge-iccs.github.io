<h4><i>Monday 19th - Friday 23rd September 2022, Cambridge, UK</i></h4>




The inaugural Institute of Computing for Climate Science (ICCS) Summer School will take place as a hybrid event in Cambridge, UK, both virtually and in-person, during the week of Monday 19th September 2022.

The summer school is <span style="text-decoration:underline">free to attend</span> and open to anyone with an interest in computational aspects
of climate science research. The summer school will combine a mix of training workshops, scientific
presentations, group discussions, social and community building activities, a poster presentation reception, and a hackathon on the last day. 

The focus of the training workshops will be on best practice software engineering methods, with intentional space for networking and fostering collaboration.
Attendees also have the opportunity to present their work via a poster and/or lightning talk, which 
may be of particular interest to early-career researchers who wish to get community exposure and feedback on their work.

For members of the Schmidt Futures [VESRI projects](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-earth-system-research-institute-vesri/), the summer school is also a chance to network between teams, give presentations on the scientific aims of your projects, and to meet and discuss with the Core team. VESRI leads will have the option to conduct a scientific session on the core science underlying their project.

The current sketch of the programme is as follows:

|                | Morning                    | Afternoon                                       |
| -------------- | -------                    | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Mon 19th    | <i><span style='color:#999;'>Arrival</span>                           | Poster reception with lunch + Welcome keynote + Science talk |
| Tue 20th   | Training workshops (x2)    | Training workshop + scientific session + discussion groups |
| Wed 21st | Training workshop + scientific session  | Lightning talks + __Excursion ([punting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat)) tour) followed by banquet in college__ |
| Thu 22nd  | Training workshop + scientific session | Discussion groups + Lightning talks + Hackathon pitches |
| Fri 23rd    | Hackathon | Hackathon + presentations, culminating in prizes |

Likely training workshop topics:

  * Verification and testing
  * Pairing and code review
  * Using Git and GitHub effectively
  * Training machine learning models
  * "Green in Code" course (how to write less resource intensive code)

On Thursday afternoon, we will have an opportunity for attendees to pitch a project for the Hackathon. This could
be either an idea for a new project or an existing project. There is then a chance to form groups for the
Hackathon, which will take place during the day Friday. On Friday afternoon, each team will have a chance to present
what they have done and a panel of judges will award a number of prizes which will be presented in the final
session.

### Logistics and registration

The summer school will take place in Cambridge, UK (venue to be announced soon).
  
Depending on demand, we may organise a block booking of accommodation at a college or nearby hotel. Otherwise, Cambridge is replete with good quality hotels and [most colleges also make their rooms available](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/cambridge/home/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_KO7BKHd9D9yhAt5q80cBarTw0ltRwbJ-GHXpl-zjx4eiIgEqdPeJQaAjzcEALw_wcB) which is an excellent way to soak up more of the Cambridge atmosphere.

If you plan to attend in-person, please indicate during the registration process which days you will need accommodation in Cambridge.

<span style="font-size:larger;">[Registration form](https://web.miniextensions.com/FYT8fFDcuuDlvWEN6Cdg)</span>

**Please register by 15th July for those attending in-person as this will affect room/accommodation booking**
  
#### COVID-19
  
With attending an in-person multi-day event, we ask that each attendee assess their own personal health risk and do what is comfortable for them and their situation. Below lists our guidelines to hold a safe and low risk event.

- COVID-19 Vaccination: We strongly encourage that each attendees be fully vaccinated with a booster against COVID-19 to attend this in-person event.

- COVID-19 Testing: Prior to attending each day of our event, we will require that all attendees take a provided at-home COVID-19 test confirming their negative status.
  
- Masking: Given the size of the event, masking may be required and will be determined closer to the event. With much of the programming indoors we support the use of a mask for part/all of the event while not eating and drinking, and will provide N95/KN95/FFP2 masks to any attendee that would like them. 

We will be closely monitoring the situation and following the guidelines of the UK government and [the procedures of the University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/coronavirus) at the time of the summer school.
