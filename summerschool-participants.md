Machine Learning is being used to learn the dynamics of the system in order to produce a forecast or long-term emulation that is able to dramatically reduce the associated computational cost when compared to numerical integration. We explore obtaining this Reduced Order Model by utilising the inertial manifold that the system lies on with machine learning, however, the Beta-Plane System is a stochastically forced system with a non-stationary manifold, so generative models will be used.</span> <br /><br /></td></tr>

His main research interest is integrating machine learning techniques into climate science.  He is specifically working on how to use machine learning to represent small-scale processes, such as convection and clouds, in climate models . Better representations of convection and clouds are urgently needed for reducing the uncertainties in climate projections. Reducing the uncertainties in climate projections is crucial for policymakers to plan ahead, and is the biggest challenge for climate scientists nowadays.
