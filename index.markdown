Computational modelling is key to modern climate science. But models are becoming
increasingly complex as we seek to understand our physical world in more depth
and model it at higher fidelity. The <strong>Institute of Computing
for Climate Science</strong> studies and supports the role of software engineering, computer science, artificial
intelligence, and data science within climate science.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
As the computational models become increasingly complicated, and more data is produced — ‘input’ from observation as well as ‘output’ from the models — there are three pressing challenges which we seek to address:
<ol>
<li>Software engineering is required to ensure that the models are robust, resource-efficient, maintainable, extendable, usable, interpretable and sustainable;
</li>
<li>Data science is required to ensure that the maximum valuable information is extracted from the various available data streams reliably and credibly;
</li>
<li>Computer science is required to develop tools, programming systems, libraries, and even programming languages to support the sustainable and robust development and deployment of increasingly complex models.
</li>
</ol>
